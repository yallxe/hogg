# Hogg üêΩ
An experimental passive website scanner. Hogg acts as a proxy between you and your DNS server and scans every website you visit for common vulnerabilities.

## Installation & Usage
Currently you can only run the daemon. In future, you will be able to use a special CLI or GUI to interact with daemon. The daemon is responsible of sending notifications.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/yallxe/hogg
cd hogg
cargo run -p hogg-deamon # requires root on linux & macos
```
After you run the daemon, you can set you DNS server to `localhost:53`, so all the DNS requests will be sent to hogg.

## Configuration
Checkout your configuration path, which is printed when you start the daemon, or use `echo $HOGG_CONFIG_DIR`

## How does it work?
1. Your browser or a desktop app resolves a domain name via DNS.
2. Hogg requests the data from your upstream DNS provider (Cloudflare by default) and sends it back to the app.
3. Hogg scans the website using [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei).

## How is it different?
Hogg will help you scan almost every website you visit (not limited to your browser) without causing any disruption to the app's functionality.

## Anything besides DNS?
Not yet. Stay tuned for future updates that may include other solutions (like an HTTP proxy).

## Limitations
- Hogg doesn't yet support DNS over HTTPS, DNS over TLS etc.
- Some apps may bypass your system's default DNS resolver. In this case, Hogg will not intercept the app's requests.

## Progress
- [x] Working DNS proxy and Nuclei scanner
- [x] Notifications (OS notifications for now)
- [ ] Automatic request redirection to DNS Proxy
- [ ] GUI (a tray icon)
- [ ] DNS over HTTPS
